es-plus-logger
==============

An Arduino based logging system for Gardner Denver速 ES+速 controllers. This logger converts
the Operating Data string and logs it to an SD card in human readable CSV format for
importing into a spread sheet or DB.

Currently only 9600 baud is supported but support is planned for 1200 as well.

This logger should work with Gardner Denver速 RS2000速 controllers but has not been tested.
